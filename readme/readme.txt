Plugin has options dialog, call it by "Options / Settings-plugins / Highlight Occurrences".

Options:
- "min_len"            : (def=1)           : Minimal length of fragment to handle
- "max_lines"          : (def=3000)        : Maximal number of lines in document; when bigger: code highlights only _visible_ occurrences (much faster)
- "max_line_len"       : (def=800000)      : Maximal length of lines, which will be handled by plugin (plugin will skip longer lines)
- "max_time"           : (def=40)          : Maximal time (in msec) to count chars in the document
- "avg_len"            : (def=100)         : Average length of line; if document has lot of longer lines, it will fallback to highlight only visible matches
- "sel_allow"          : (def=True)        : Plugin handles current selection (on selection changing)
- "sel_allow_spaces"   : (def=False)       : Plugin allows whitespace in selection, otherwise trim it
- "sel_case_sens"      : (def=False)       : Search for selection is case-sensitive
- "sel_words_only"     : (def=False)       : Plugin handles selection only when it is whole word
- "sel_whole_words"    : (def=False)       : Search for selection finds whole words only
- "sel_lines_max"      : (def=3)           : Maximal count of selected lines allowed to handle. E.g. if you select 5000 lines, plugin won't search such selection.
- "mark_ignore_min_len": (def=False)       : Mark occurrences of selected text ignores 'min_len' option. Related to "Plugins / Highlight Occurrences / Select all occurrences" option
- "visible_fallback"   : (def=True)        : When text is over max_lines - fallback to highlighting only in visible text
- "caret_allow"        : (def=True)        : Plugin handles word under caret (on caret moving)
- "caret_case_sens"    : (def=True)        : Search for word under caret is case-sensitive
- "caret_whole_words"  : (def=True)        : Search for word under caret finds whole words only

- "theme_item_other"   : (def="BracketBG") : Element of syntax-theme, which color is used for other found matches
- "lexers_allowed"     : (def="")          : If not empty, plugin is active only for mentioned lexers. Comma-separated list, None-lexer must be written as '-'
